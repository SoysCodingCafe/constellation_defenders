### Known Issues
The web build can take some time to load so please be patient! Due to this, some of the sound effects come at a slight delay. If you are experiencing issues then please let me know in the comments, or try the downloadable version for your platform. Only the Windows and Linux builds have been tested but they should run a lot smoother than the web version.

### Dev Notes
All the art and writing in the game were done by me using Aseprite, and the palette swapping is handled by a WGSL shader I wrote.

All the music and sound effects were done by me using LMMS, specifically using the FreeBoy and sfxr built-in plugins.

If you are curious about how I achieved any effects or are confused by the code then don't hesitate to get in touch!
